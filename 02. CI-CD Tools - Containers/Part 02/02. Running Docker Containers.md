### Running Docker Containers  

Running Docker containers is one of the core steps in using Docker for deploying applications. A **container** is a runtime instance of a Docker image that includes everything needed to execute an application, such as the code, dependencies, and system settings.  

To run a container, the `docker run` command is used. It creates a new container from an image and starts it. For example, running `docker run nginx` starts a container with the Nginx web server. You can also specify options like port mapping (e.g., `-p 8080:80`) to make the container accessible on a specific port.  

Containers are lightweight and isolated, meaning they don’t interfere with other containers or the host system. However, they can still interact with each other through Docker’s networking features, which is useful for creating multi-container applications.  

Containers can also be run in the background using the `-d` (detached) option or interactively with `-it` for debugging or testing. When a container is no longer needed, it can be stopped with `docker stop` and removed with `docker rm`.  

In summary, running Docker containers is straightforward and flexible. It allows developers to quickly deploy applications in a consistent, isolated environment, making it an essential part of modern DevOps workflows.

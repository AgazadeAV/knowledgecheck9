**Managing Docker Containers**

Managing Docker containers is an essential skill when working with containerized applications. Docker provides a variety of commands to handle the lifecycle of containers, from creation to removal.

To start a container, you use the `docker run` command, which can include options like setting environment variables, binding ports, or mounting volumes. For example, `docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-app` runs a container in detached mode and maps port 8080 on your machine to port 80 inside the container.

Once running, you can view active containers using `docker ps`. To include stopped containers, you use `docker ps -a`. Managing containers also includes stopping (`docker stop`), restarting (`docker restart`), or removing them (`docker rm`).

You can check container logs with `docker logs [container_id]`, which is helpful for debugging. If you need to access a running container, `docker exec -it [container_id] bash` lets you interact with it through a terminal.

To manage resources and clean up, commands like `docker prune` can remove unused containers, networks, and images.

In short, managing Docker containers involves starting, stopping, monitoring, and cleaning up containers efficiently. Mastering these commands is key to maintaining a smooth workflow in a containerized environment.

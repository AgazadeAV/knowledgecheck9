### Building Docker Images

Building Docker images is a key part of working with Docker containers. A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run an application, like the code, dependencies, and configuration.

To build a Docker image, you start with a **Dockerfile**, which is a simple text file that contains instructions for creating the image. For example, you can specify a base image, like Ubuntu or Alpine, and then add application files, install dependencies, or run commands.

The main steps for building an image are:

1. **Create a Dockerfile** – Define the base image and steps to prepare your application.
2. **Use the `docker build` command** – This command reads the Dockerfile and generates the image step by step.
3. **Tag your image** – Add a name and version tag to identify the image, making it easier to share or reuse.

Once the image is built, it can be stored in a **container registry**, such as Docker Hub, and used to run containers anywhere Docker is installed.

The benefits of building Docker images include **portability**, as the same image can run on different environments, and **consistency**, ensuring that the application behaves the same way across development, testing, and production.

In short, building Docker images is an essential step in creating portable, reliable, and reusable containerized applications.

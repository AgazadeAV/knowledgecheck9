**CI/CD Pipeline Integration with Containers**  

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines combined with containers simplify and speed up the software delivery process. Containers, such as those managed by Docker, provide a consistent environment for applications, from development to production.  

When integrating containers into a CI/CD pipeline, the pipeline typically follows these steps:  
1. **Code Changes and Builds**: Developers push code to a repository (like GitHub or GitLab). The pipeline automatically triggers a build, creating a Docker image of the application.  
2. **Testing**: The containerized application is tested in isolated environments, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the host system.  
3. **Staging and Deployment**: Once tests pass, the container image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub). The pipeline can then deploy the image to staging or production environments using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Compose.  
4. **Monitoring and Rollbacks**: Continuous monitoring ensures the application runs smoothly. If issues are detected, containers can be quickly rolled back to a previous version.  

Using containers in a CI/CD pipeline improves consistency, portability, and scalability. It reduces "it works on my machine" issues and ensures that the application behaves the same way across all environments.

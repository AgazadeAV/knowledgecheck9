### Docker Images  

Docker images are a key part of containerization, providing a lightweight and portable way to package applications and their dependencies. A Docker image is essentially a blueprint for creating containers, containing everything needed to run an application, such as the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.  

One of the main advantages of Docker images is consistency. Since the image includes all dependencies, it ensures the application runs the same way across different environments, whether it's a developer's machine, a test server, or production.  

Docker images are built using a **Dockerfile**, which is a script that defines the steps to create the image. For example, the Dockerfile specifies the base image, application files to copy, and commands to run during the build process.  

Once built, Docker images can be stored in repositories like **Docker Hub** or private registries, making them easy to share and reuse. This helps streamline workflows and reduces setup time for new environments.  

In summary, Docker images are essential for creating portable, reliable, and efficient applications in modern DevOps practices. They enable faster deployments and ensure consistent performance across all stages of development.

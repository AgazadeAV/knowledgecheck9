### Introduction to Docker

Docker is a tool that makes it easier to build, ship, and run applications using containers. Containers are lightweight, portable environments that include everything needed to run an application, such as code, libraries, and system tools. 

The main idea behind Docker is to ensure that an application works consistently across different systems. For example, if an application runs on a developer's computer, it will run the same way in testing and production environments.

Docker uses **Dockerfiles** to define how a container should be built, including which operating system, software, and dependencies are needed. Once a container is created, it can be shared using Docker Hub or other container registries, making collaboration and deployment easier.

The key benefits of Docker include **portability**, because containers can run on any system with Docker installed, and **efficiency**, as containers use fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines. Docker also supports **scalability**, allowing teams to quickly spin up multiple containers to handle increased demand.

In summary, Docker simplifies application development and deployment by providing consistent and portable environments, making it a popular choice in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.

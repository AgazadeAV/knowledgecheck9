Here’s a simple explanation of **Docker Containers vs. Docker Images**:

---

**Docker Images** and **Docker Containers** are core concepts in Docker, and understanding their differences is key to working with containers effectively.

### **Docker Images**
- **What is a Docker Image?**  
   A Docker Image is a blueprint or template used to create containers. It’s a lightweight, standalone, and immutable package that includes everything needed to run an application—code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.  
- **Key Points:**  
   - Images are **read-only**.  
   - They are built using a `Dockerfile`, which defines the instructions for creating the image.  
   - Images are stored in a Docker registry, like Docker Hub, so they can be reused or shared.

### **Docker Containers**
- **What is a Docker Container?**  
   A Docker Container is a running instance of a Docker Image. It’s a real-time execution environment that includes everything defined in the image, but with the ability to make changes during runtime.  
- **Key Points:**  
   - Containers are **mutable** and can have data written or modified.  
   - They are lightweight, as they share the host system’s kernel rather than needing their own operating system.  
   - Containers can be started, stopped, or removed without affecting the original image.

### **Key Differences**
1. **Purpose:**  
   - **Image:** A static template used to create containers.  
   - **Container:** A dynamic, running instance of an image.
2. **State:**  
   - **Image:** Read-only and doesn’t change.  
   - **Container:** Can be modified at runtime.
3. **Usage:**  
   - **Image:** Built once and used to create multiple containers.  
   - **Container:** Created from an image and used to run applications.

### **Example Workflow**
1. Build an image using a `Dockerfile`.  
2. Use the image to create one or more containers.  
3. Run, stop, or remove containers as needed.

In summary, a Docker Image is like a recipe, and a Docker Container is the finished dish made from that recipe. Both are essential in containerized application development.

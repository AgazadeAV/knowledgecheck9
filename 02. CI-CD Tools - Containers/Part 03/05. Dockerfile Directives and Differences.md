**Dockerfile Directives and Differences**

A Dockerfile is a script that defines how to build a Docker image. It uses various directives, each serving a specific purpose in the image-building process. Understanding the key directives and their differences is crucial for creating efficient and reusable images.

Some common Dockerfile directives include:

1. **FROM**: Specifies the base image for the new image. It is the first directive in most Dockerfiles. For example, `FROM ubuntu:latest` sets the base image to the latest version of Ubuntu.

2. **RUN**: Executes a command during the image build process, like installing software or setting up the environment. Multiple `RUN` commands can be used, but combining them into one reduces image layers.

3. **CMD**: Provides the default command to run when a container starts. It can be overridden during runtime. For example, `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`.

4. **ENTRYPOINT**: Similar to `CMD`, but it is harder to override. It is useful for creating images that always run a specific command.

5. **COPY** and **ADD**: Both copy files from the host to the image. `COPY` is simpler and should be used for static files. `ADD` can also handle remote URLs and automatically extract archives, but it’s better to use `COPY` unless you need these features.

6. **ENV**: Sets environment variables within the image, making them available during runtime. For example, `ENV APP_ENV=production`.

7. **EXPOSE**: Informs Docker about the ports the container will use, such as `EXPOSE 8080`. It doesn’t actually open ports but helps document the image.

The key differences between directives, like `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` or `COPY` and `ADD`, affect how the image behaves and should be chosen based on the use case.

In summary, Dockerfile directives are building blocks for creating Docker images. Choosing the right directives and understanding their differences helps in building optimized and predictable images.

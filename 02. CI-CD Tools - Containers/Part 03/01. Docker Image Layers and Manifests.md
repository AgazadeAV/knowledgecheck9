Here’s a concise explanation of **Docker Image Layers and Manifests**:

**Docker Image Layers and Manifests**  

A Docker image is made up of layers. Each layer represents a set of changes, like installing software or adding files. These layers are created when you write commands in a Dockerfile. For example, the `FROM` command pulls the base image, the `RUN` command adds new layers with software installations, and so on.  

Layers are reusable and shared. If multiple images use the same base or layers, Docker doesn’t duplicate them. This makes Docker images lightweight and fast to build.  

The **manifest** is like a map of the image. It contains metadata about the image, such as the list of layers, size, and the image architecture (e.g., Linux, ARM). When you pull an image from a registry, the manifest helps Docker assemble the image with all its layers.  

Key points:  
1. **Layers**: Build the image step by step, reducing duplication and improving speed.  
2. **Manifest**: Describes how to combine layers and gives details about the image.  
3. **Efficiency**: Reusing layers saves time and space during builds and deployments.  

By understanding layers and manifests, you can optimize your Docker images for better performance and maintainability.

### Docker Networking Concepts  

Docker networking is a key feature that allows containers to communicate with each other and with external systems. It provides flexibility for creating isolated or shared networks depending on the application’s needs.  

There are several types of Docker networks:  

1. **Bridge Network**: This is the default network for containers. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other directly, while external access requires port mapping. It’s commonly used for standalone applications.  

2. **Host Network**: In this mode, the container shares the host machine’s network stack. This eliminates network isolation, making the container’s network performance similar to running the application directly on the host.  

3. **Overlay Network**: This is used for multi-host communication, often in swarm or Kubernetes clusters. It allows containers on different hosts to connect securely as if they were on the same network.  

4. **None Network**: In this mode, the container has no network access. It’s useful for highly isolated environments.  

Docker also provides features like DNS resolution, allowing containers to communicate by name instead of IP addresses, and network drivers for more advanced configurations.  

In summary, Docker networking ensures containers can connect flexibly and securely, whether within a single machine or across multiple hosts, making it essential for building scalable, distributed applications.

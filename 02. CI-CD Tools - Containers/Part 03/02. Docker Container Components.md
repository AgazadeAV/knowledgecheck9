### Docker Container Components

A Docker container is a lightweight, portable unit that runs an application and all its dependencies. It works by using key components to ensure consistency and efficiency. Here are the main components of a Docker container:

1. **Image**: A container starts from a Docker image. The image is like a blueprint that defines everything needed for the container, including the application, libraries, and system tools.

2. **Filesystem**: Each container has its own isolated filesystem. It includes the application code and dependencies from the image, but it is separate from the host system, ensuring security and consistency.

3. **Processes**: Containers run processes just like any other application, but these processes are isolated. They only see and interact with the containerâ€™s environment, not the host or other containers.

4. **Networking**: Docker provides networking capabilities so containers can communicate with each other and the outside world. By default, each container has its own IP address and can connect to networks defined in Docker.

5. **Storage**: Containers can use volumes for persistent data storage. This allows data to be saved and shared across containers, even if the container itself is restarted or deleted.

6. **Runtime Environment**: The container runtime, provided by Docker, manages the lifecycle of containers, including starting, stopping, and removing them.

In summary, Docker containers are made up of images, an isolated filesystem, processes, networking, storage, and a runtime environment. These components work together to make containers lightweight, portable, and efficient for running applications.

### Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)  

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key practices in DevOps that help teams deliver software faster and with fewer errors.  

**CI** is all about merging code changes into a shared repository frequently, often multiple times a day. Every time new code is added, automated tests are run to check if the changes work well with the existing code. This helps catch bugs early, saving time and effort later in the process. Tools like **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and **GitLab CI** are commonly used for CI.  

**CD** takes this one step further. Once the code passes all tests, it is automatically deployed to production or a staging environment. This means the software is always in a ready-to-release state. CD ensures that users get updates quickly and with minimal manual intervention. Tools like **Docker** and **Kubernetes** are often used to support CD pipelines.  

Together, CI and CD create a seamless workflow. They improve collaboration, reduce risks, and make software development more efficient. This approach allows teams to focus on delivering value to users while maintaining high quality.

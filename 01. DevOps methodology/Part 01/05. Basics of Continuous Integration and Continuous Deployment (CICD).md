**Basics of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key practices in modern software development under the DevOps methodology. They focus on automating and improving the process of delivering applications, ensuring faster and more reliable updates.  

**Continuous Integration** involves regularly merging developers' code changes into a shared repository. Each change is automatically tested using a build pipeline. The main goal is to catch bugs early, improve code quality, and make integration seamless. Key points of CI include:  
1. **Frequent Code Merging**: Developers integrate their changes often, reducing conflicts and making collaboration easier.  
2. **Automated Testing**: Tests run automatically after each code commit to ensure the new changes don’t break existing functionality.  
3. **Fast Feedback**: Developers quickly receive results on whether their changes are successful or need adjustments.  

**Continuous Deployment**, on the other hand, extends CI by automating the process of delivering code to production. Once the code passes all automated tests, it’s automatically deployed to users without manual intervention. Key benefits include:  
1. **Rapid Releases**: Updates and features are delivered to customers quickly and consistently.  
2. **Automation**: Deployment processes are standardized and less error-prone because they don’t rely on manual steps.  
3. **Improved Reliability**: Frequent deployments allow teams to identify and resolve issues faster, ensuring a stable product.  

Together, CI/CD pipelines help teams improve collaboration, reduce development cycles, and maintain high-quality software delivery. These practices are essential for adapting to user needs and staying competitive in a fast-paced industry.

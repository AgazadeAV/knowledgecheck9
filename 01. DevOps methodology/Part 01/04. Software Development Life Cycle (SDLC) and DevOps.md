**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and DevOps**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that outlines the stages of creating software, from planning and design to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It provides a structured approach to ensure the software meets requirements and is delivered on time. Common SDLC models include Waterfall, Agile, and Spiral, each offering a different way to manage tasks and timelines.

DevOps, on the other hand, is a methodology that focuses on improving collaboration between development and operations teams. Its goal is to automate and streamline the processes of building, testing, and deploying software. DevOps incorporates practices like continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), which ensure that code is frequently integrated and deployed with minimal manual intervention.

When combining SDLC and DevOps, the traditional stages of SDLC become more efficient. For example, automated testing in the DevOps pipeline speeds up the testing phase, while infrastructure-as-code (IaC) simplifies deployment and reduces errors. DevOps aligns with iterative SDLC models like Agile, where frequent releases and feedback loops are crucial.

In summary, SDLC provides the structure for software creation, while DevOps enhances the process by introducing automation, collaboration, and faster delivery cycles. Together, they ensure high-quality software is developed and maintained efficiently.
